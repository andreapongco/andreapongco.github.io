                <h2>My favorite CMSC course so far is CMSC 131</h2>
                <p>It is my favorite CMSC course because it is easy to understand and fun to work with. Our instructors in the lecture videos were also amazing as they could narrow down difficult topics into simple ones. The diagram-making is my favorite part of the exercises because they are therapuetic and satisfying to do. They can get stressful sometimes though, especially when you miss some inputs.</p>

                <h2>My favorite GE course so far is ETHICS 1</h2>
                <p>It is may favorite GE course because my professor was so good at teaching it and his voice was soothing. Aside from that, the course itself is engrossing as it tells how we came about every mindset and prinpiciples that exists now, including those questionable ones sadly. It's also amazing how these are applied to everything, mostly in politics though.</p>

                <h2>My favorite programming language so far is Java</h2>
                <p>Even though I was stressed out in installing and configuring an IDE for it, I still like Java because of its features. At first, I really hate it as I find its syntax difficult to be familiarized with and Eclipse IDE being difficult to work with. Also, I think Object-Oriented Programming is just generally hard to understand at first. However, this changed when I encountered an indie Java Game Developer in YouTube named ThinMatrix. He uploads development logs of his game in his channel and ever since then, I was motivated to study Java. After watching him, I restudied Java and I found myself loving it more. Maybe, because I have now finally found a fun application of a programming language.<br><br> I haven't mastered everything about it of course, but you can love something without being good at it.</p>

                <h2>My favorite food is fishball</h2>
                <p>There's is just something comforting with this food especially when it is eaten along the streets after a long tiring day from school. It's also super affordable! Maybe I also like it because there's that mundane feeling when you eat it while watching people and cars pass-by.</p>

                <h2>My childhood dream was to be an astronaut</h2>
                <p>Maybe because they're amazingly portrayed in movies and their equipment are so advanced. I also dreamt of living in spaceships because their place has a lot of cool stuff.</p>
